## Project Description

A web application with user registration functionality has been created, enabling users to post advertisements for used cars. All data is securely stored in a Xano database, which facilitates efficient data management and access. The forthcoming phase of the project involves developing the front end using Webflow and Wized technology. This strategy is aimed at crafting a fully functional low-code application that simplifies the development process without compromising on the application's performance and user engagement.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register by providing their name, email, password, and phone number.
- **User Login**: Enables registered users to log in using their email and password.
- **Ad Posting**: Registered users can post ads by submitting a form that includes details like the car's make, price, fuel type, year, and a photo.
- **View Ads**: Users can view all posted ads on a dedicated page, which displays information such as the car's make, price, year, and an image.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for ads based on criteria like make, year range, price range, fuel type, and body type.
- **Selected Ad Details**: Users can click on an ad to view detailed information about the car, including its make, price, year, fuel type, and contact phone number.
- **User Logout**: Allows users to log out, clearing their session information.
